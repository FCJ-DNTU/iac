# Examples with Terraform
In this folder, we'll give you some example with terraform.

## Prerequisites
You can do these examples in your own pc or an EC2 on AWS. But we recommend that you should use Linux for all of the examples.

1. If you use windows, you should install WSL2 (recommend `Ubuntu 24.04 LTS`). Read more about here: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
2. Install docker
    - Windows: [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/). Remember to enable the "WSL2 Integration" in Docker Desktop settings.
    - Linux: [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux/), will depend on your distribution.
3. Install Terraform. Read more about here: [https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install).

When you done all of the requirements, let's roll.
